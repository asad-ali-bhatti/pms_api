### Carl Finance:

Due to limited time along with my job I managned to achieve only few parts of the tasks. But these complete tasks will 
show you my knowledge of RAILS framework and approach towards solving the problem. If you still think its not enough 
I can answer your questions in a later interview.

Thanks,
